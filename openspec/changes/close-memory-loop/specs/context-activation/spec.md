## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Read-only activation operation
The product SHALL expose a read-only operation `activate_context` that accepts a raw
user turn (`turn`, non-empty text), an optional `max_chars` (default 4000, clamped
to 500..8000), an optional declared `purpose`, an optional `include_timings`
flag, and optional `client` and `session` attribution, and returns a working-memory
packet. The operation SHALL be reachable over the
same leaf function on MCP, the CLI (`exomem activate "<turn>"`, with `--client` and
`--session`) and the personal REST facade (`/api/activate_context`). It SHALL perform
no vault write, SHALL NOT change the
hits, ordering or envelope of `ask_memory`/`find` for any input, and SHALL run no model
other than the retrieval scorers ordinary recall already runs.

Each call SHALL append one row to a host-local activation log beside the existing query
logs, outside the vault. The row SHALL carry the client label the transport observed or,
failing that, a declared `client` matching a short software-label pattern, a stable
per-vault hash of `session` rather than its value, a hash identifying the vault, the transport, the outcome and
packet-derived counts. It SHALL NOT carry the turn text, and SHALL omit anchor
identifiers when the packet is content-private. An invalid `client` or an oversize
`session` SHALL be recorded as invalid and never refused or echoed. `client` and
`session` SHALL NOT change the packet's material. `session` MAY select the caller whose
session start carries the optional `upkeep` block that the adaptive-memory-maintenance
capability defines, and nothing else. On the MCP door only, while
proactive capture is permitted, the packet MAY carry a one-sentence `episode_due`
advisory after repeated activations from one caller without an episode record, at most
once per bounded interval; it SHALL NOT appear on the CLI or REST doors, nor for a
Claude Code or Codex MCP client whose hook this vault's activation log shows served it
within that interval.

#### Scenario: Same packet on every door
- **WHEN** the same turn is submitted through MCP, the CLI and the REST facade against
  the same vault state and index generation
- **THEN** the three responses carry the same anchors, roles, units, pointers and
  budget accounting

#### Scenario: Ordinary recall is untouched
- **WHEN** `ask_memory` is called with any arguments before and after this change is
  installed and the activation index exists
- **THEN** its hits, ordering and envelope are byte-identical

#### Scenario: Kill switch abstains without building
- **WHEN** `EXOMEM_DISABLE_WORKING_SET` is set in the server process
- **THEN** `activate_context` returns a packet with `abstained: true` and
  `abstention.reason = "disabled"`, no activation index is created or opened, and the
  tool remains on the surface so the tool-surface digest is independent of the switch

#### Scenario: Attribution never changes the packet
- **WHEN** the same turn is submitted against the same vault state with and without
  `client` and `session`, or with an invalid label or oversize session
- **THEN** the packets are identical apart from the continuity token each call mints,
  the optional `upkeep` block, whose session start the `session` identifies, and
  `budget.used_chars`, which counts that block's item when one is attached
- **AND** the call is never refused over its attribution

#### Scenario: The turn is never recorded
- **WHEN** an activation is logged
- **THEN** its row carries neither the turn text nor the raw session value
- **AND** a content-private packet's row carries no anchor identifiers
